# Sort-Article

Project of studies and analyzes of sorting algorithms .

## Goal

The goal of the project is analyze some of the sort algorithms,
calculating the time it takes to order a vector in each situation.

## The situations are

### Vectors:

```
.Vector of 5000 positions.
.Vector of 50000 positions.
.Vector of 100000 positions.
```
### Orders

```
.Ascending order.
.Descending order.
.Random Order.
```
### Algorithms

```
.Insertion sort.
.Selection sort.
.Quick sort.
```

## Analisys

After doing several tests on different computers,
it is possible to analyze the results obtained
to study the best situation to use a certain algorithm.
